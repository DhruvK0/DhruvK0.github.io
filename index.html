                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Our statistics inference project will study how long it takes in minutes for students to get ready in the morning for school. The question that we seek to answer was whether or not freshmen take longer to get ready in the morning than seniors do.</p>
                    <h2>Motivation</h2>
                    <p>We asked this question because we were curious if there was actually a difference between these two groups in our high school, Del Norte High School. We think that the seniors take less time than the freshmen because they have been in high school for 4 years and as a result, they have set up a routine for how they get ready every morning. Whereas the freshmen who have just entered high school are not accustomed to the environment.</p>

                <div id="stdy"><h2>Study Design</h2>
                    <p>For this observation, we need to survey both freshmen and seniors and compare the results. To do this we randomly selected classes that were majority freshmen and classes that were majority seniors. These were classes such as ENS 1, Bio 1, HHSE 1, etc for the freshmen and classes like World Lit, AP Stats, AP Gov, etc for the seniors. Then we would sample every freshman or senior in the class that was chosen. Randomly selecting these classes is crucial as it allows us to generalize to the populations, which in this case would be all of the seniors and freshmen at Del Norte High School. In addition, we also needed at least 30 responses from both groups, that is because to do all of the calculations the data needs to be approximately normal and by the Central Limit Theorem the data would be approximately normal if we have 30 responses from each.</p>

                <h2>Accounting for Bias</h2>
                <p>Reducing bias, variability, and confounding is important when sampling because if not taken into account you could end up with a type I or type II error. One step that we took in ensuring minimum confounding is by sampling students from the same school we can reasonably assume that all the students will keep the same relative age, education level, and distance from school. With all of this being accounted for we can make a conclusion on whether or not there actually is a difference in the time it takes to get ready in the morning for freshmen and seniors.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>From our data samples, we concluded that Freshmen take more time to get ready in the morning than Seniors. On average the Seniors took about 21 minutes to get ready in the morning for school, whereas the Freshman took on average about 45 minutes to get ready, which is more than double the time. One reason that we thought that this difference exists was that Seniors are getting lazier and waking up later in the morning, as a result, they have less time to get ready in the morning than freshmen would. Additionally, Freshmen might be more concerned about appearance and how comfortable they are around their peers as compared to seniors. This would mean that freshmen would be more inclined to wake up earlier to carefully get ready so that they look better. Seniors on the other hand would be more comfortable around other seniors, so they may not feel the need to take the time to get fully ready, rather they might just wake up, quickly put on clothes, and go to school. This in turn would mean that seniors take much less time to get ready. There were also factors that could pose potential bias that we could have accounted for when taking the samples. One of the biggest factors we could have changed is sampling people from the same first period class for both freshmen and senior samples. This is important because different first periods determine how important it is for them to arrive at school on time. Some teachers are more lenient with how much they let students in their class after the bell, which would have an effect on how much time they take to get ready. All in all, we can conclude that freshmen at Del Norte generally take more time to get ready than seniors at Del Norte.</p>
