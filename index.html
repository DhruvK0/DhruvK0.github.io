                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Our statistics inference project will study how long it takes in minutes for students to get ready in the morning for school. We will sample two groups of students, seniors and freshmen, as we are curious as to whether or not there is a difference between the time seniors take to get ready as opposed to freshmen. The main question we have is whether or not freshmen take longer to get ready in the morning than seniors do. We think that the seniors take less time than the freshmen because they have been in high school for 4 years and as a result they have set up a routine for how they get ready every morning. Whereas the freshmen who have just entered high school are not accustomed to the environment. Our null hypothesis will be that the mean time to get ready for seniors is the same as that of freshman, so the difference of means between time to get ready for the freshman group and the senior group will be 0. The alternative hypothesis will be that the mean time to get ready for school in the morning for freshmen will be longer than the mean time that seniors take to get ready. Since we will be sampling times to get ready for two groups of students, we will analyze the means of these two datasets and find out whether there is a difference in times, particularly if the time for freshmen is longer than the seniors. We will also find the probability that the time for a freshman to get ready is longer than the time for a senior to get ready, and whether or not it is statistically significant. After that, we will also calculate a confidence interval with 95% confidence to see the range in the difference of means between the times to get ready for seniors in the morning vs the time to get ready for freshmen.</p>

                <div id="stdy"><h2>Study Design</h2>
                    <p>For this observation, we need to survey both freshmen and seniors and compare the results. To do this we will randomly get classes that are mostly freshmen by going through a list of all the classes that are unique only to freshmen, ENS 1, Bio 1, HHSE 1, etc. Then put those classes into a list, assigning them each a unique number. Finally, we will randomly select a number by using a random number generator and survey every freshman in the class with the coinciding number. We are looking to get a total of 30 freshmen responses however if a class does not have enough freshmen then we will randomly select another freshmen class and survey enough freshmen to get up to 30 responses. We will do the same to get our results from the senior class. We will list all the classes that are mostly unique only to seniors, World Lit, AP Stats, AP Gov, etc. Then put those classes into a list, assigning them each a unique number. Finally, we will randomly select a number by using a random number generator and survey every senior in the class with the coinciding number. We are looking for 30 senior responses however if a class does not have enough seniors to get up to 30 responses then we will randomly select another senior class and survey enough seniors to get up to 30 responses.</p>

                <h3>Accounting for Bias</h3>
                <p>Reducing bias, variability, and confounding is important when sampling because if not taken into account you could end up with a type I or type II error. One step that we took in ensuring minimum confounding is by sampling students from the same school we can reasonably assume that all the students will keep the same relative age, education level, and distance from school. With all of this being accounted for we can make a conclusion on whether or not there actually is a difference in the time it takes to get ready in the morning for freshmen and seniors.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>From our data samples, we concluded that Freshmen take more time to get ready in the morning than Seniors. On average the Seniors took about 21 minutes to get ready in the morning for school, whereas the Freshman took on average about 45 minutes to get ready, which is more than double the time. One reason that we thought that this difference exists was that Seniors are getting lazier and waking up later in the morning, as a result, they have less time to get ready in the morning than freshmen would. Additionally, Freshmen might be more concerned about appearance and how comfortable they are around their peers as compared to seniors. This would mean that freshmen would be more inclined to wake up earlier to carefully get ready so that they look better. Seniors on the other hand would be more comfortable around other seniors, so they may not feel the need to take the time to get fully ready, rather they might just wake up, quickly put on clothes, and go to school. This in turn would mean that seniors take much less time to get ready. There were also factors that could pose potential bias that we could have accounted for when taking the samples. One of the biggest factors we could have changed is sampling people from the same first period class for both freshmen and senior samples. This is important because different first periods determine how important it is for them to arrive at school on time. Some teachers are more lenient with how much they let students in their class after the bell, which would have an effect on how much time they take to get ready. All in all, we can conclude that freshmen at Del Norte generally take more time to get ready than seniors at Del Norte.</p>
